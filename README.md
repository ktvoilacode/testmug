## 💡 The Problem

**Manual testers waste 90% of their time writing test cases instead of actually testing.**

- Enterprises spend **$20-30B annually** on manual testing (56% of all testing spend)
- Current automation tools require coding skills
- **Nobody solved test design labor** - only execution speed

**Example**: Testing a login flow requires writing 50+ test cases covering positive, negative, and edge scenarios. This takes hours of repetitive documentation work.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Testmug = Record Once → AI Generates 50 Test Cases → Auto-Execute → Get Reports**

A desktop application that lets manual testers (no coding required) generate comprehensive test suites from recorded user flows, reducing test creation time by **90%**.

### How It Works

```
Record one happy path flow (2 min)
         ↓
AI generates 10-50 test cases (1 min)
         ↓
Edit in Excel if needed (optional)
         ↓
Run all tests in parallel (5 min)
         ↓
Get Excel + Word reports with screenshots
```

**Inspiration**: Lovable/Bolt.new proved "describe intent → AI builds it" works for non-coders. We apply this to test design.
